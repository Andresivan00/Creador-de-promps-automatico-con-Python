# Automatic Prompt Creator (Python & Tkinter)

A desktop app designed and implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. The main purpose of the project is to allow users to generate coherent and descriptive prompts based on a series of predefined categories, styles, and lighting conditions. These prompts are useful for AI-based image generation tools. The application organizes options visually and dynamically, validating user selections and building a final prompt that can be copied to the clipboard.

**General Objective:** Develop an interactive desktop application that enables the creation of detailed and coherent prompts for visual AI models, dynamically combining categories, styles, lighting, and composition, providing users with an intuitive tool for generating high-quality creative content.

**Specific Objectives:**

* Design an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface that facilitates the selection of categories, elements, styles, lighting, and composition.
* Implement adaptive prompt generation logic that combines user choices with detailed and coherent descriptions.
* Validate user selections to ensure all fields are complete before generating the prompt.
* Incorporate clipboard copy functionality and dynamic visualization of the generated prompt.
